# Cognitive Residual Load in Routine Numerical Micro-Decisions

This repository documents an observed behavioral pattern occurring during short-duration mental calculations in professional routines.

## Observed Pattern

Mental calculations lasting approximately **3–15 seconds** tend to produce simultaneously:

- high subjective confidence
- low spontaneous verification
- insufficient numerical precision for safe decisions

This region is referred to as:

**non-audited familiar calculation zone**

## Occurrence Context

The pattern appears across different operational environments:

- technical parameter adjustments  
- quick operational validations  
- administrative plausibility checks  
- laboratory routine confirmations  

## Practical Effect

Operational deviations frequently originate from trivial decisions rather than complex tasks.
